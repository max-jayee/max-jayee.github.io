# UTM Installation

## Introduction

Refer to the official site.

### For macOS

#### Brew

Follow the process below.

```bash
brew update

brew search utm

brew install utm --cask
```

#### Github

Click a "[Download from Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/latest/download/UTM.dmg "https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/latest/download/UTM.dmg")" link.

#### Mac App Store

Click a "[Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817 "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817")" link.  
> Note: UTM is and always will be completely free and open source. The Mac App Store version is identical to the GitHub version and there are no features left out. The only advantage of the Mac App Store version is that you can get automatic updates. Purchasing the App Store version directly funds the development of UTM and shows your support â™¥.
